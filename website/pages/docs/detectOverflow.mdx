# detectOverflow

This function computes the overflow offsets of either the
reference or floating element relative to any clipping
boundaries.

Almost every middleware provided by the library uses this
function, making it useful for your own custom middleware.

The function takes two arguments and returns a promise:

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, options);
```

## Usage

Inside your custom middleware, make your `fn` `async` and `await`
it, passing in the `middlewareArguments`:

```js
import {detectOverflow} from '@floating-ui/dom';

const middleware = {
  name: 'middleware',
  async fn(middlewareArguments) {
    const overflow = await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments);
    return {};
  },
};
```

The returned value, `overflow`, is a `SideObject` containing side
properties with numbers representing offsets.

- A positive number means the element is overflowing the clipping
  boundary by that number of pixels.
- A negative number means the element has that number of pixels
  left before it will overflow the clipping boundary.
- `0` means the side lies flush with the clipping boundary.

## Options

`detectOverflow` takes options as a second argument.

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, {
  // options
});
```

### boundary

```ts
type Boundary = 'clippingParents' | Element | Array<Element>;
```

This describes the clipping element(s) that overflow will be
checked relative to. The default is `clippingParents`, which are
the scrolling containers (including `overflow: hidden` elements)
which will cause the reference or floating element to be clipped.

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, {
  boundary: document.querySelector('#container'),
});
```

### rootBoundary

```ts
type RootBoundary = 'viewport' | 'document';
```

This describes the root boundary that the element will be checked
for overflow relative to. The default is `viewport`, which is the
area of the page the user can see on the screen. The other option
is `document`, which is the entire page outside the viewport.

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, {
  rootBoundary: 'document',
});
```

### padding

```ts
type Padding =
  | number
  | Partial<{
      top: number;
      right: number;
      bottom: number;
      left: number;
    }>;
```

This describes the virtual padding around the boundary to check
for overflow.

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, {
  // 5px on all sides
  padding: 5,
  // Unspecified sides are 0
  padding: {
    top: 5,
    left: 20,
  },
});
```

### elementContext

```ts
type ElementContext = 'reference' | 'floating';
```

By default, the floating element is the one being checked for
overflow.

But you can also change the context to `reference` to instead
check its overflow relative to its clipping boundary.

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, {
  elementContext: 'reference', // 'floating' by default
});
```

### altBoundary

This is a boolean value which determines whether to check the
alternate `elementContext`'s boundary.

For instance, if the `elementContext` is `floating`, and you
enable this option, then the boundary in which overflow is
checked for is the `reference`'s boundary. This only applies if
you are using the default `clippingParents` enum as the
`boundary`.

```js
await detectOverflow(middlewareArguments, {
  altBoundary: true, // false by default
});
```
