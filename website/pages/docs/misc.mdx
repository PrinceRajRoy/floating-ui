## Subpixel and accelerated positioning

Instead of `top` and `left` as shown throughout the docs, you can
use `transform: translate()` instead to position the floating
element. This enables the floating element to be positioned more
accurately on the device's subpixel grid (high PPI displays).

```js
Object.assign(floatingEl.style, {
  top: '0',
  left: '0',
  transform: `translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`,
});
```

Note that this can cause blurring, so you'll want to **round**
the `x` and `y` coordinates in some fashion.

```js
// Checking `window.devicePixelRatio` when rounding improves
// this further
transform: `translate(${Math.round(x)}px, ${Math.round(y)}px)`;
```

### 3D transforms

You can also promote the floating element to its own layer:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
transform: 
  `translate3d(${Math.round(x)}px, ${Math.round(y)}px, 0)`;
```

If you're animating the location of the floating element, this
will offer smoother animations. Most modern browsers have async
and passive scrolling, so using `top` and `left` to position the
floating element is generally fine performance-wise.

## Transforms on elements

A `transform` on a reference element will not cause any
positioning issues. You should be wary of these cases though:

### floating

If the floating element has a `scale` transform, ensure you
specify a `transform-origin` depending on its placement.

### parent

If a parent of the reference and floating element is scaled, the
position will be **incorrect**. To solve this, place the floating
element outside of the scaled parent context.

### body

If `<body>` is translated, the position will be offset by that
amount. It's possible to create your own custom middleware to
handle these types of cases if necessary, but for most users it
is not relevant.
